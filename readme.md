[A(nother)](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0533/2089/files/javascript-frameworks-days.png?18059098111826468152) Node.js web "framework" with focus on [backend-for-frontend](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/bff-soundcloud) development.

## Still in development
Please do not use on production. Still on heavy development.

## How does it work?
Rosalina is mostly configuration-based. You define the body parameters, querystrings,
headers to send to specific backend endpoints instead of declaring which actions
are made on a defined route.

## Why?
BFF development can be very tedious, specially when BFF just passes parameters.

## Why Node.js?
Most of Backend-for-frontend work is done as
[frontend development](http://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) using
Javascript as the main language on all web-based frontends.
